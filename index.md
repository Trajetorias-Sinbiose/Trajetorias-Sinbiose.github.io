## Mission

**Trajetórias** seeks to integrate knowledge about the Brazilian Amazon region, in its economic, human, ecological and epidemiological dimensions. The aim is to develop methods for linking health outcomes to the ecosystem services provided by the Amazon biome, and their relationship to competing land use trajectories.

This project is supported by the CNPq's Scientific Synthesis in Biodiversity Center ([SinBiose](http://www.sinbiose.cnpq.br/web/sinbiose)).

Listen to the interviews about the analyzes made by our researchers on the trajectories observed in the Amazon. 

Episode 4! Researchers Ana Rorato (INPE), Ana Paula Dal'Asta (INPE) and Raquel Lana (Fiocruz) are the data hunters. The "Trajetorias" project depends on the ability to extract knowledge from multiple data sources for the elaboration of a synthesis that involves social, economic and health aspects. This is far from trivial work and requires multiple challenges. In this episode, we talk to the professionals about the frustrations, successes and challenges of this activity.

## Publications

###Scientific publications

In 2021, we published the conceptual paper ["Epidemiology, Biodiversity, and Technological Trajectories in the Brazilian Amazon: From Malaria to COVID-19"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.647754). This article investigates the distribution of dominant technoproductive trajectories (TTs) in the Brazilian Amazon and their association with environmental degradation and vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases. The results challenge simplistic views that the dominant trajectory of development in the Amazon will optimize economic, health and environmental indicators. This approach lays the groundwork for a narrative that is more integrated and consistent with the economic history of the Brazilian Amazon.

In feb 2023, the datapaper ["Trajetorias: a dataset of environmental, epidemiological, and economic indicators for the Brazilian Amazon"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01962-1) was published. The Trajetorias dataset is a harmonized set of environmental, epidemiological, and poverty indicators for all municipalities of the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The indicators allows for analyzing the spatial and temporal relationship between economic trajectories linked to the agrarian systems’ dynamics, habitat fragmentation and disease risk.
